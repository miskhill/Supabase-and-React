**Weekend Supabase Project**

I wanted to try the Firebase alternative Supabase and see how I could use this for future projects to quickly and easily make a backend. I found it very simple and intuitive to use with lots of code snippets and help along the way. I also used some new React functions I hadn't previously used due to using older versions of React. I completed this over a weekend and have listed some improvements I could make further down the ReadMe. 

**Learns**

1. Using the useNavigate hook to navigate quickly between pages when I completed a section!
2. useParams - to get the ID of the selected smoothie
3. pre-populating the edit form with the smoothie details
4. Setting up the Supabase backend database
5. Using the Supabase client to query the database
6. Using the client to then insert, update and delete data from the database
7. Using Supabase to set some customer security afterwards so users could not edit/delete all smoothies

**Improvements**

1. Continue with Authorisation and allow login/logout
2. Authorisation to allow delete and edit for individual users
3. Styling - I was more interested in Supabase and the backend than styling but I could improve this

Below is the basic page to enter or edit a smoothie.
